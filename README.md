# Introduction to React JS v2

An introduction to React (version 2) - up and running with React by learning React core API (including Hooks!) and common how-to e.g. making ajax calls, writing tests, and code splitting.

[V1 website][v1-website]

> This repo outlines the content of the workshop - please refer to this [repo][code-along-repo] for the code-along sample of this workshop.

## Prerequisite

This workshop assumes that:

- you have at least basic understanding of HTML/CSS/JS. If you know how to add a button element in a HTML and a script tag to make clicking the button do something interactive like a popup, then you're good to go.
- you have at least basic experience using command line interface. If you know how to change directory with `cd` and create folder with `mkdir`, then you're good to go. If you're not, go through this [Codecademy course][cli-course] - Module 1 (Navigating the File System) and Module 2 (Viewing and Changing the File System) are sufficient for this course.

## Setup

To avoid the workshop time being spent on downloading and installing tools, make sure you have the following software installed before the workshop starts:

- node.js and npm ([Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
- git ([Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
- VS code ([Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)) - you can use other editor if you wish, but when discussing editor integration, this workshop will focus on VS code only.

Besides, sign up a [GitHub] account if you doesn't have one yet.
