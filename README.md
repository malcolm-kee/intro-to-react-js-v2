# Introduction to React JS v2

A complete introduction to React (version 2) - up and running with React by learning React core API and common how-to e.g. making ajax calls, writing tests, and code splitting.

[V1 website][v1-website].

> This repo outlines the content of the workshop - please refer to this [repo][code-along-repo] for the code-along sample of this workshop.

## Prerequisite

This workshop assumes that:

- you have at least basic understanding of HTML/CSS/JS. If you know how to add a button element in a HTML and a script tag to make clicking the button do something interactive like a popup, then you're good to go.

## Setup

To avoid the workshop time being spent on downloading and installing tools, make sure you have the following software installed before the workshop starts:

- node.js and npm ([Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
- git ([Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
- VS code ([Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)) - you can use other editor if you wish, but when discussing editor integration, this workshop will focus on VS code only.

Besides, sign up a [Github] account if you doesn't have one.
